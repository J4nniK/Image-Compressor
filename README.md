# image-compressor-java
The purpose of this program is to compress multiple images to a smaller filesize. <br>A usecase for this would be an upload limit for image files. <br>With this program you could make the images smaller until they have a proper size and then upload them again.

## Features

- **Configurable compression value** <br>This program is using a slider where you can set the value of how far you want to compres the actual images

- **Bulk compression** <br>It is possible to compress multiple images at once which will save a lot of time
 
- **Modern look** <br>The GUI of the program will change according to the OS that you use.

### Upcoming Milestones

- **<ins>Q4 2024</ins>**:
